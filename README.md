### Fork

### Build

Note: You need PIO CLI in order to build krates on the command line. You can either download it via VS Code and install the PIO extension, or [install](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/methods/index.html) it separately.  

We recommended using VS Code/PIO IDE for development, but in demo videos below we will demonstrate how to develop krates entirely in the terminal for a quick overview of our contribution process.
